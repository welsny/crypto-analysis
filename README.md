### Quantity Always Trumps Quality

From (Coding Horror)[https://blog.codinghorror.com/quantity-always-trumps-quality/]:

```
The ceramics teacher announced on opening day that he was dividing the class into two groups. All those on the left side of the studio, he said, would be graded solely on the quantity of work they produced, all those on the right solely on its quality. His procedure was simple: on the final day of class he would bring in his bathroom scales and weigh the work of the "quantity" group: fifty pound of pots rated an "A", forty pounds a "B", and so on. Those being graded on "quality", however, needed to produce only one pot - albeit a perfect one - to get an "A".
Well, came grading time and a curious fact emerged: __the works of highest quality were all produced by the group being graded for quantity.__ It seems that while the "quantity" group was busily churning out piles of work - and learning from their mistakes - the "quality" group had sat theorizing about perfection, and in the end had little more to show for their efforts than grandiose theories and a pile of dead clay.

Keep in mind that this advice shouldn't be taken too literally, and that it applies more to the code-writing process than the resulting code itself. Follow good coding practices such as [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) and [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) to avoid making code that is unneccesarily verbose or overcomplicated. Maintain the best code quality standards possible at your current ability level; just don't get caught in theoretical musings.
